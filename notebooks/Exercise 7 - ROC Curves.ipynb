    "# Measuring Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "You have learned about the efficiency of the CMS recommended top tagging algorithm. But how did we decide on those variables and those specific cuts? To measure performance of different algorithms, we use the \"Receiver-Operator Characteristic\" curve (ROC curve). The ROC curve shows background efficiency as a function of signal efficiency. Better-performing algorithms will have higher signal efficiency for the same background efficency, or lower background efficiency for the same signal efficiency. These can be plotted several different ways, sometimes using background rejection (1 - efficiency) instead of background efficiency.\n",

    "You can produce ROOT files for various signal and background samples to study this:\n",
